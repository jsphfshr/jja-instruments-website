## Product 1: Mark V Doppler String Phantom

### What It Is
The Mark V Doppler String Phantom is the industry standard for Doppler ultrasound velocity calibration and quality assurance testing. It uses a precisely controlled moving filament (string) to simulate blood flow, allowing technicians to verify that their ultrasound systems measure velocity accurately.

### Why It Matters
- Uncalibrated ultrasound systems can produce velocity measurement errors of 10-20%
- Inaccurate velocity measurements can lead to misdiagnosis of carotid stenosis, cardiac valve disease, and other conditions
- Accreditation bodies (ACR, IAC, ICAVL, Joint Commission) require documented QA testing
- Regular calibration ensures patient safety and diagnostic accuracy

### Key Specifications
- **Velocity Range:** 10-200 cm/s (covers all clinical blood flow velocities)
- **Accuracy:** +/-1% of reading, NIST-traceable
- **Resolution:** 0.1 cm/s
- **Stability:** +/-0.5% over 8 hours
- **Probe Compatibility:** 2-15 MHz (all major ultrasound manufacturers)
- **Doppler Angles:** 30, 45, 60 degree guides for angle correction verification
- **Acoustic Window:** TPX membrane, 60x120mm
- **String Target Depth:** 2-8 cm adjustable
- **String Material:** 0.1mm nylon monofilament
- **Dimensions:** 45 x 25 x 18 cm
- **Weight:** 5.2 kg (11.5 lbs)
- **Power:** 100-240V AC, 50/60Hz universal
- **Data Export:** USB with PDF and CSV output
- **Certifications:** CE marked, IEC 62359 compliant
- **Warranty:** 2 years comprehensive

### How It Works (String Phantom vs Flow Phantom)
Unlike traditional flow phantoms that use blood-mimicking fluid (which requires temperature control, degassing, and regular fluid replacement), the Mark V string phantom uses a mechanically driven filament at crystal-controlled velocities. This provides:

- **100% Repeatability:** Crystal-controlled motor drive eliminates velocity drift
- **Zero Fluid Maintenance:** No blood-mimicking fluid to mix, degas, or replace
- **5-Minute Setup:** No temperature stabilization required
- **Direct NIST Traceability:** Mechanical velocity is directly traceable

### Compatible Ultrasound Systems
Works with all diagnostic ultrasound systems from: GE Healthcare, Philips, Siemens Healthineers, Canon Medical (Toshiba), Samsung Medison, Fujifilm/Hitachi, Mindray, and all other manufacturers with Doppler capability.

### Clinical Applications
1. **Vascular Laboratory QA** - Carotid stenosis grading (NASCET/ECST criteria), peripheral arterial/venous assessment, DVT diagnosis
2. **Echocardiography** - Transmitral/transaortic flow velocities, E/A ratio, valve gradient measurements
3. **Obstetric Doppler** - Umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery, fetal well-being assessment
4. **Transcranial Doppler** - Stroke risk, vasospasm monitoring, brain death protocols
5. **Equipment Acceptance Testing** - New system installation verification
6. **OEM Production Testing** - End-of-line QA for ultrasound manufacturers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Doppler Phantom FAQ

**Q: How often should Doppler ultrasound equipment be calibrated?**
A: The ACR and IAC recommend Doppler velocity verification at least annually. Many accredited vascular laboratories perform quarterly calibration checks. Additional testing is recommended after equipment service, software updates, or transducer replacement.

**Q: What is the difference between a string phantom and a flow phantom?**
A: String phantoms use a moving filament at precisely controlled velocities, providing consistent, reproducible results with minimal maintenance. Flow phantoms use blood-mimicking fluid and better simulate certain acoustic properties but require temperature control and regular fluid replacement. For Doppler velocity calibration, string phantoms offer superior accuracy and practicality.

**Q: Is the Mark V compatible with my ultrasound system?**
A: Yes. Compatible with all diagnostic ultrasound systems with Doppler capability, including GE, Philips, Siemens, Canon (Toshiba), Samsung, Fujifilm, Mindray, and others. 2-15 MHz probe compatibility covers virtually all clinical transducers.

**Q: What blood flow velocities can I test?**
A: 1-400 mm/s, spanning venous flow (10-30 cm/s), normal arterial flow (30-100 cm/s), and peak systolic velocities (up to 200 cm/s and beyond).

**Q: What is tissue-mimicking material?**
A: TMM replicates acoustic properties of human tissue (speed of sound ~1540 m/s, attenuation, backscatter). High-quality TMMs remain stable for years and provide consistent test conditions.

### HIFU Generator FAQ

**Q: What is HIFU and how does it work?**
A: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound uses focused acoustic energy to heat targeted tissue to 60-85C, causing coagulative necrosis. An RF power generator drives piezoelectric transducers that focus ultrasound waves to a precise point - like sunlight through a magnifying glass - while sparing surrounding structures.

**Q: What components are needed for a complete HIFU system?**
A: A frequency generator, timing circuits, RF power amplifier, impedance matching, safety systems, control interface, and transducer. The JJ&A HIFU RF Power System integrates everything except the transducer.

**Q: Is the generator MRI-compatible?**
A: Yes, we offer MRI-compatible versions with EMI shielding for MRgFUS applications, validated at 1.5T and 3T field strengths.

**Q: What safety features are included?**
A: VSWR protection, over-temperature shutdown, arc detection, hardware interlocks, and software-defined power/duration limits.

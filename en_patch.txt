    "doppler.faq.title": "Ultrasound QA FAQ",
    "doppler.faq.q1": "How often should Doppler ultrasound equipment be calibrated?",
    "doppler.faq.a1": "The American College of Radiology (ACR) and Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) recommend Doppler velocity verification at least annually. Many accredited vascular laboratories perform quarterly calibration checks as part of their quality assurance program. Additional testing is recommended after equipment service, software updates, transducer replacement, or any time measurement accuracy is questioned.",
    "doppler.faq.q2": "What accreditation standards require ultrasound QA testing?",
    "doppler.faq.a2": "Multiple accrediting bodies require documented ultrasound quality assurance programs: <strong>ACR</strong> (American College of Radiology) requires annual phantom testing; <strong>IAC</strong> (Intersocietal Accreditation Commission) covers echocardiography and vascular testing; <strong>ICAVL</strong> (Intersocietal Commission for the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories) requires velocity accuracy verification; <strong>The Joint Commission</strong> mandates equipment management and QA programs; and <strong>AIUM</strong> (American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine) publishes practice guidelines. Our phantom and documentation support all these standards.",
    "doppler.faq.q3": "What is the difference between a string phantom and a flow phantom?",
    "doppler.faq.a3": "String phantoms use a moving filament at precisely controlled velocities, eliminating variables like blood-mimicking fluid temperature, viscosity, and particle concentration. This provides more consistent, reproducible calibration results with minimal maintenance. Flow phantoms with blood-mimicking fluid can better simulate certain acoustic properties like scattering, but require temperature control, regular fluid replacement, and more complex setup. For Doppler velocity calibration, string phantoms offer superior accuracy and practicality.",
    "doppler.faq.q4": "Is the Mark V compatible with my ultrasound system?",
    "doppler.faq.a4": "Yes. The Mark V Doppler Phantom is compatible with all diagnostic ultrasound systems with Doppler capability, including GE, Philips, Siemens, Canon (Toshiba), Samsung, Fujifilm, Mindray, and other manufacturers. The 2-15 MHz probe compatibility covers virtually all clinical transducers used in vascular, cardiac, obstetric, and general imaging applications.",
    "doppler.faq.q5": "What blood flow velocities can I test?",
    "doppler.faq.a5": "The Mark V covers 1-400 mm/s, spanning the full range of clinical blood flow velocities: venous flow (10-30 cm/s), normal arterial flow (30-100 cm/s), and peak systolic velocities in stenotic vessels or cardiac applications (up to 200 cm/s and beyond). This range supports carotid stenosis grading, peripheral vascular assessment, cardiac valve evaluation, obstetric Doppler, and transcranial Doppler applications.",
    "doppler.faq.q6": "How does NIST-traceable calibration work?",
    "doppler.faq.a6": "NIST-traceable calibration means our phantom's velocity accuracy can be documented through an unbroken chain of comparisons back to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Each Mark V ships with a Certificate of Calibration showing measurement uncertainty and traceability. Annual recertification maintains this traceability—essential for regulatory compliance and accreditation audits.",
    "doppler.faq.q7": "What documentation is provided for accreditation?",
    "doppler.faq.a7": "Each Mark V ships with a Certificate of Calibration traceable to NIST standards. The unit exports test results in PDF and CSV formats compatible with ACR, IAC, ICAVL, and Joint Commission accreditation requirements. We also provide template QA protocols, testing procedure documentation, and guidance for laboratory accreditation submissions. Our support team can assist with specific accreditation documentation requirements.",
    "doppler.faq.q8": "Do you support OEM and research applications?",
    "doppler.faq.a8": "Yes. We supply doppler phantoms to ultrasound OEM manufacturers for production testing and QA, to medical device developers for R&D and regulatory submissions, and to academic institutions for research and education.

    "hifu.faq.title": "HIFU Generator FAQ",
    "hifu.faq.q1": "What is HIFU and how does it work?",
    "hifu.faq.a1": "High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) uses focused acoustic energy to heat and destroy targeted tissue non-invasively. An RF power generator drives piezoelectric transducers that convert electrical energy into ultrasound waves. These waves are focused to a precise point in the body—like sunlight through a magnifying glass—where temperatures reach 60-85°C, causing thermal ablation of the target tissue while sparing surrounding structures.",
    "hifu.faq.q2": "What frequency should I use for my HIFU application?",
    "hifu.faq.a2": "Frequency selection depends on treatment depth and target tissue. <strong>Lower frequencies (0.5-1 MHz)</strong> penetrate deeper (up to 15 cm) and are used for tumor ablation in liver, kidney, and prostate. <strong>Mid-range frequencies (1-3 MHz)</strong> are common for neurological HIFU and general therapeutic applications. <strong>Higher frequencies (3-7 MHz)</strong> provide precise, shallow penetration for aesthetic treatments targeting skin layers. Our team can help you select the optimal frequency for your specific application.",
    "hifu.faq.q3": "Is the generator compatible with MRI environments?",
    "hifu.faq.a3": "Yes. We offer MRI-compatible versions with EMI shielding and non-magnetic construction for MR-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) applications. These generators can operate inside the MRI suite without interfering with imaging. The shielded version has been validated at 1.5T and 3T field strengths. Contact us to discuss your specific MRI integration requirements.",
    "hifu.faq.q4": "Can the generator drive phased array transducers?",
    "hifu.faq.a4": "Yes. We offer multi-channel configurations with up to 256 independently controlled channels for phased array transducers. Each channel provides individual amplitude and phase control for electronic beam steering and focal point adjustment. Multi-channel systems include synchronization features for coherent operation. Single-element and annular array transducers are also fully supported.",
    "hifu.faq.q5": "What safety features are included?",
    "hifu.faq.a5": "Safety is built into every generator: <strong>VSWR protection</strong> automatically reduces power if reflected power exceeds safe limits (prevents transducer damage). <strong>Over-temperature protection</strong> monitors internal temperatures and shuts down before overheating. <strong>Arc detection</strong> instantly cuts power if arcing is detected in the RF path. <strong>Hardware interlocks</strong> support external safety switches and emergency stops. <strong>Software limits</strong> allow you to define application-specific power and duration limits.",
    "hifu.faq.q6": "What regulatory documentation is available?",
    "hifu.faq.a6": "We provide comprehensive documentation to support your regulatory submissions: <strong>Design history file</strong> including specifications, test reports, and traceability. <strong>Risk analysis</strong> per ISO 14971. <strong>EMC test reports</strong> per IEC 60601-1-2. <strong>Electrical safety testing</strong> per IEC 60601-1. <strong>Certificates</strong> of conformance and calibration.
